# AI Customer Service Agent for Telecom

## Problem Statement

Telecom companies receive thousands of customer queries daily, with nearly 70% being repetitive or simple questions such as "How do I check my data balance?", "Why is my bill high?", or "How do I activate roaming?" Traditional support systems make customers wait on hold and overload human agents, causing lower customer satisfaction and high operational costs.

## Solution

We built an AI-powered knowledge assistant that instantly answers common telecom support queries by learning from past customer tickets and conversations. Users can interact through a text API or by calling a phone number and talking to the AI agent directly. For complex or sensitive issues, the system uses smart escalation rules to automatically connect the customer to a human agent, ensuring efficient and accurate support.

## Key Features

- 24/7 Automated Query Resolution: Instant answers for most customer queries.
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Engine: Pulls real answers from historical tickets and dialogues.
- Voice Call Integration with Twilio: Customers can call and speak directly to the AI agent.
- Smart Escalation: Automatically detects issues needing human intervention (e.g., low AI confidence, billing or security problems, negative sentiment).
- Source Citations: Answers include source ticket/dialogue IDs for transparency and auditability.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- AI Framework: LangChain (RAG pipeline)
- Vector Database: ChromaDB or FAISS
- LLM: OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 (or self-hosted alternatives like Ollama/Groq)
- Voice/Calling: Twilio Voice API, Media Streams
- Speech Recognition: Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text
- Text-to-Speech: gTTS, ElevenLabs, or similar
- Data: Open customer support ticket/dialogue datasets (Kaggle, HuggingFace)

## How It Works

1. User asks a question via Agent Chatbot or Phone call.
2. System retrieves similar cases from the telecom support database (vector search).
3. LLM generates a response using RAG, citing real ticket/dialogue sources.
4. If needed, the system escalates the conversation to a human agent following smart escalation rules.

## Components & Responsibilities

- Ingest & Indexing: Parse historical tickets and conversations, create embeddings, and store vectors in ChromaDB/FAISS.
- Retrieval Layer: Query the vector DB to fetch relevant documents for a given user query.
- LLM RAG Layer: Prompt the LLM with retrieved context and generate answers that include inline citations (ticket/dialogue IDs).
- Voice Integration: Twilio Media Streams to stream audio, Speech-to-Text to transcribe, feed text into the RAG pipeline, and use TTS for voice responses.
- Escalation Engine: Rules-based and model-confidence checks to transfer calls or open tickets for human agents.

## Source Citations

All generated answers should include a short citation list (ticket ID or dialogue ID and short excerpt) so support agents can verify the source and audit the response.

## Example Usage

- Text API: POST /api/query with JSON {"user_id": "1234", "query": "How do I check my data balance?"}
- Voice: Configure Twilio to forward calls to your voice webhook and use Twilio Media Streams to send audio to your transcription service, then pass the transcription into the same RAG/query pipeline.
